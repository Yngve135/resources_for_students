# Web Development Resources
These resources have been gathered to help get students up-to-speed on web development.

## Main Learning Tools
Each of these websites can answer nearly any web development question you have.  They both have very long tutorials which move quite slowly through the basic concepts.  I recommend clicking around for a few minutes on each site, and then treating them as a definitive reference after you learn the basics.
* [Mozilla Developer's Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

## Must-do
I think these activities/sites will get you quickly up and running in web development.
1. The _LearnXinYMinutes_ site has some great, quick explanations for people who have experience working with some programming concepts and want to get up-to-speed with others.
    * [HTML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/html/)
    * [CSS](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/css/)
    * There's also [JavaScript](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/), but this one isn't as good as the above two...probably because it's such a _much_ larger concept.
1. If at this point you're still feeling a bit confused on the basic ideas of HTML hierarchies and CSS Selectors, read through [this article](https://www.internetingishard.com/html-and-css/).  That website, _InternetingIsHard_, has lots of helpful articles, but they are quite verbose.  If you like their style, look through for some other content!
1. I think the [CSS Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) is a particularly important thing to understand.  It should help you understand whether you want to change _padding_ or _margin_.
1. Now that you understand basic HTML and CSS, I would argue that understanding CSS flexbox will allow you to layout any design.  This is a three-part process:
    1. [This video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw) covers the basic concepts.  It's a bit dry (sorry!), but it does the job.
    1. Quickly look over [this site](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and bookmark it.  It is a useful reference while designing with flexbox, not a learning tool.
    1. Now, work through the exercises on [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).
    1. If you're still feeling a bit lost on how to incorporate this into an actual website, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc), which works through five examples.
1. At this point, just keep making websites!

* [Footers that Stay Down](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/VBbRGG): a surprisingly difficult problem.  Also solvable with flexboxes!
* [Transitions](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/bjbavx): Simple smooth animations using just CSS.
* [Hidden Content](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/XBKWjw): Showing and hiding content using JavaScript to create a menu that displays different content when the user clicks on buttons.
* [Adding and Removing Dom Nodes](https://codepen.io/nicholaszufelt/pen/OwRWNb): It is crucial to understand how JavaScript can change the DOM (the Document Object Model, or the in-memory version of the website).

### Specific Tools
These sites are helpful for learning specific tools.

##### Flexbox
(These are the same as above.)
* [Learn Flexbox](https://youtube.com/watch?v=4GaHn08BXQw)
* [Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
* [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)
* [Flexbox Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k32voqQhODc): a 30-minute video that works through 5 flexbox examples

##### CSS Grid
* [Mozilla's Tutorial on CSS Grid](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid): Mozilla made this to advertise their new CSS Grid inspector in their developer tools, so it's a slightly themed toward that, but it's still an excellent explanation of CSS Grid.
* [CSS Grid Garden](http://cssgridgarden.com/): Like flexbox froggy but for CSS Grid.

### Reading
* [My HTML/CSS/JavaScript basic code style guide](https://github.com/nzufelt/ace10_summer2018/blob/master/webdev_code_style.md).  It doesn't handle much, but it's enough to get you started with styling your code.
* [r/webdev's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/wiki/faq): "How do I become a web developer?"
* [r/web_design's FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/wiki/faq): "How do I learn to style websites?"
