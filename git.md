# Resources for learning `git`

Learning git can be a bit of a frustrating experience, because it both has a bit of a steep learning curve and is one of those tools that feels so obvious once you understand it.  Plus, for some reason the materials out there are less than perfect for various reasons.  I have gathered here a couple of resources which together should give you enough of a start for you to be successful.

### Main Steps
* Watch this [decent git video](https://youtu.be/Y9XZQO1n_7c?t=154) (starts after install information).  It's not perfect, but it will walk you through the basic commands.
* Read [The Git Parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html), a long blog post outlining the ideas behind `git` and why they exist.  It does a good job of demystifying `git` and convincing you that it is not something magical, that you could absolutely construct a (perhaps less optimized) version of `git` with enough time.
* Bookmark and glance through [The Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).  This is the main official-ish book on `git`.  This should be your reference for any specific questions you have about the tool.
* Glance through [Learn Git in 30 minutes](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/learn-git-in-30-minutes).  It's going to be repetitive from the previous items, so it's on you to decide how much repetition you need.  It's helpful to have this open in another window while you do the following:
* At this point, I believe that you just need to suffer through getting started with managing your own `git` repository, and learn by doing. There is plenty more to learn, but I don't think at this point you'll really feel ready to learn more until you have some experience.

### Secondary
All of these tools are still not bad, but I feel like they aren't necessary.

* [Git from the inside out](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/two/git-from-the-inside-out): This is my personal favorite resource for deeply learning and loving `git`.  It's intense, and requires you to dive into the internals of the tool, but I promise you will come out with a *much* stronger understanding of how `git` works.  This is not your very first introduction to `git`, though; you'll need to have seen the basic commands and have a rudementary understanding of their functionality first.
* [Think like (a) Git](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git.html): One thing I really like about this guide is the slow ramp-up pace. It takes the time to discuss how difficult it can be to learn git, and it also talks at length about graphs and why they are so important to understand first before learning git.
* [git - the simple guide ](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/): Yes, the author swears in this guide.  It's still a helpful resource.
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): This is an interactive tool which is awesome for understanding the manipulation of source code graphs (Often called "source trees").  However, one thing it doesn't do is show when, where, and how the actual files in the respository are being editted.
* [Derek Banas video on `git`](https://youtu.be/r63f51ce84A?t=395) (starts after the intro, installation stuff): It's not how I would have organized the content, but it's not bad.
